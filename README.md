## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to use it

After you have installed the bot he will invite every user in the config in a channel. Accept the invite and you are ready to interact with him.

### New Reminder

To make a new reminder talk to the bot like this: 
* `make laundry at sunday 16:00`
* `walking with the dog 6am`
* `brunch with alan at sunday`

It tries to understand your natural language as best as it can. 

### List all available commands 

To get all commands just type one of these lines:
* `commands`
* `list all commands`
* `show all commands`
* `help`

### Set timezone

* `set timezone Europe/Berlin`

### Daily reminder overview

To activate a daily message with the reminders of the day:

* `set daily reminder at 10:00`
* `change daily reminder to 10am`

To deactivate it:

* `delete daily reminder`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

In any case you need a config file with your preferences and credentials.

1. Copy the `config.example.yml` from the repository
2. Rename it to `config.yml`
3. Fill in the settings
    1. `debug` do not touch unless you know what you are doing
    2. `matrixbotaccount` those are the credentials and the homeserver (url of the matrix instance) of the bots account. You need to create one yourself.
    3. `matrixusers` those users will be able to interact with the bot. Enter a username in the format `@username:instance.tld` so for the user "test123" at the instance "matrix.org" this would be `@test123:matrix.org`
    4. `database` enter a database connection here. You need to enter a MySQL [connection string](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name). If your database-server is running at the domain "mydatabase.org" at port 3306 and your credentials to log in are "root" and "12345" and the database you created is named "remindme_database" then your connection string would look like this: `root:12345@tcp(mydatabase.org:3306)/remindme_database`.
4. Now you need to copy the file to the folder where the binary is executed.
    * Using the "plain" method: put the binary you build and the config file in the same folder. Execute them from there.
    * Using the pre-build docker image you need to mount the file to `/run/config.yml`

### Plain

1. Download the code
2. Run `go build -o /app/bin /app/cmd/remindme/main.go` to build the binary in `/app/bin`
3. Setup your config file
4. Run the binary

### Docker
